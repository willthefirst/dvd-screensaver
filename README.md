# Todo

- Continue from here: https://youtu.be/8JJ-4JgR7Dg?t=2003
    - We currently have a working ray vs rectangle options
        - There's a small bug it seems, maybe deal with this before moving forward.
    - Using that, we can implement a rectangle vs. rectangle option.
        - Can we get a dynamic rectangle to bounce correctly off of a static rectangle?
    - If so, can we get two rectangles to bounce dynamical off of one another?
- Implement collision detection explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ-4JgR7Dg);
- Get a code review...use Typescript, classes?
    - Add some nicer documentation/comments
- Give an option to hit the corner every time.
- Maybe rebuild this in Elm?
